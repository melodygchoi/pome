Objects Used to Prop Open a Window,"Dog bone, stapler,\n\ncribbage board, garlic press\n\n     because this window is loose—lacks\n\nsuction, lacks grip.\n\nBungee cord, bootstrap,\n\ndog leash, leather belt\n\n     because this window had sash cords.\n\nThey frayed.

The New Church,"The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone\n\namong fir trees, but it took him an hour\n\nfor the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,\n\nthe village passed him by, greeted him,\n\nasked about his health, but everybody hurried\n\nto catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,\n\nmeasuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.\n\nHe yearned for the day when the new church\n\nwould be built—right across the road. Now\n\nit rises above the moon: saints in frescoes\n\nmeet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut\n\nthrough the shingles on the roof of his empty\n\nhouse. The apple trees have taken over the sky,\n\nsequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.",Lucia Cherciu,,0
Look for Me,"Look for me under the hood\n\nof that old Chevrolet settled in weeds\n\nat the end of the pasture.\n\nI'm the radiator that spent its years\n\nbolted in front of an engine\n\nshoving me forward into the wind.\n\nWhatever was in me in those days\n\nhas mostly leaked away,\n\nbut my cap's still screwed on tight\n\nand I know the names of all these\n\ntattered moths and broken grasshoppers\n\nthe rest of you've forgotten.",Ted Kooser,,0
Wild Life,"Behind the silo, the Mother Rabbit\n\nhunches like a giant spider with strange calm:\n\nsix tiny babies beneath, each\n\nclamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.\n\nThis may sound cute to you, reading\n\nfrom your pulpit of plenty,\n\nbut one small one was left out of reach,\n\na knife of fur\n\nbarging between the others.\n\nI watched behind a turret of sand. If\n\nI could have cautioned the mother rabbit\n\nI would. If I could summon the\n\nBunnies to fit him in beneath\n\nthe belly's swell\n\nI would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishing\n\nfor some equity. This must be\n\nwhy it's called Wild Life because of all the\n\ncrazed emotions tangled up in\n\nthe underbrush within us.\n\nDid I tell you how\n\nthe smallest one, black and trembling,\n\nhopped behind the kudzu\n\nstill filigreed with wanting?\n\nShould we talk now of animal heritage, their species,\n\ncreature development?

Umbrella,"When I push your button\n\nyou fly off the handle,\n\nold skin and bones,\n\nblack bat wing.\n\nWe're alike, you and I.\n\nBoth of us\n\nresemble my mother,\n\nso fierce in her advocacy\n\non behalf of\n\nthe most vulnerable child\n\nwho'll catch his death\n\nin this tempest.\n\nSuch a headwind!\n\nSometimes it requires\n\nall my strength\n\njust to end a line.\n\nBut when the wind is at\n\nmy back, we're likely\n\nto get carried away, and say\n\nsomething we can never retract,\n\nsomething saturated from the ribs\n\ndown, an old stony\n\nword like ruin.

Don’t Bother the Earth Spirit,"Don’t bother the earth spirit who lives here. She is working on a story. It is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate, changing. If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you.

The One Thing That Can Save America,"Is anything central?\n\nOrchards flung out on the land,\n\nUrban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?\n\nAre place names central?\n\nElm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?\n\nAs they concur with a rush at eye level\n\nBeating themselves into eyes which have had enough\n\nThank you, no more thank you.\n\nAnd they come on like scenery mingled with darkness\n\nThe damp plains, overgrown suburbs,\n\nPlaces of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.\n\n \n\nThese are connected to my version of America\n\nBut the juice is elsewhere.\n\nThis morning as I walked out of your room\n\nAfter breakfast crosshatched with\n\nBackward and forward glances, backward into light,\n\nForward into unfamiliar light,\n\nWas it our doing, and was it\n\nThe material, the lumber of life, or of lives\n\nWe were measuring, counting?\n\nA mood soon to be forgotten\n\nIn crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow\n\nIn this morning that has seized us again?\n\n \n\nI know that I braid too much on my own\n\nSnapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.\n\nThey are private and always will be.\n\nWhere then are the private turns of event\n\nDestined to bloom later like golden chimes\n\nReleased over a city from a highest tower?\n\nThe quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,\n\nAnd you know instantly what I mean?\n\nWhat remote orchard reached by winding roads\n\nHides them? Where are these roots?\n\n \n\nIt is the lumps and trials\n\nThat tell us whether we shall be known\n\nAnd whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.\n\nAll the rest is waiting\n\nFor a letter that never arrives,\n\nDay after day, the exasperation\n\nUntil finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,\n\nThe two envelope halves lying on a plate.\n\nThe message was wise, and seemingly\n\nDictated a long time ago, but its time has still\n\nNot arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited\n\nSteps that can be taken against danger\n\nNow and in the future, in cool yards,\n\nIn quiet small houses in the country,\n\nOur country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.",John Ashbery,,0
"[""Hour in which I consider hydrangea""]","Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.",Simone White,"Living,Parenthood,The Body,The Mind,Nature,Trees & Flowers",7
Stung,"She couldn't help but sting my finger,\n\nclinging a moment before I flung her\n\nto the ground.

Bounden Duty,"I got a call from the White House, from the\n\nPresident himself, asking me if I’d do him a personal\n\nfavor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.\n\nPresident, anything you like.” He said, “Just act\n\nlike nothing’s going on. Act normal. That would\n\nmean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,\n\nsure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’s\n\nhow I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’m\n\ntortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”\n\nbit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I was\n\ndying to tell someone that the President himself called\n\nme, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure to\n\nact normal was killing me. And what was going on\n\nanyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. I\n\nsaw the President on TV yesterday. He was shaking\n\nhands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really a\n\nfarmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenly\n\nI was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.\n\nI looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked more\n\nlike I was trying to be normal. That’s pretty\n\nsuspicious. I opened the door and looked around.\n\nWhat was going on? There was a car parked in front\n\nof my car that I had never seen before, a car that\n\nwas trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.\n\nIf you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise\n\npeople will think something’s going on. I got into\n\nmy car and sped down the road. I could feel those\n\nlittle radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,\n\nbut, apparently, they were under orders not to stop\n\nme. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’s\n\ngoing on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.\n\nI hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Just\n\ngetting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t know\n\nyou had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.\n\nYou’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes I\n\nrefer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a private\n\njoke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” she\n\nasked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promise\n\nyou. Everything is normal. The President shook\n\nhands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that such\n\na big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “and\n\nthat man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, I\n\nknow,” I said, feeling better.\n\n ",James Tate,"Humor & Satire,History & Politics",7

A Wish,"I wanted to give you something for your pain.\n\nBut not the drug du jour\n\nor the kind word this side of cliché.\n\nSomething you wouldn’t find on a talk show,\n\nin a department store or dark alleyway.\n\nI wanted to give you something for your pain\n\n \n\nbut I couldn’t imagine what.\n\nFrankincense, myrrh—even gold\n\nseemed too plain (too plain and too gross).\n\nI needed something that wouldn’t have occurred\n\nto you or me, or even Nature: a creature\n\nmore fabulous, more imaginary\n\n \n\nthan you’d find in a rain forest or tapestry\n\nor pixel-loaded screen.

I wanted to give you\n\nsomething for your pain that didn’t smack\n\nof a sorcerer’s trick, or a poet’s swoon,\n\nor a psychiatrist’s quip. Nothing too heavy\n\n \n\nor spacey or glib. I’d have given you the moon\n\nbut it’s been done (and besides, its desolate dust\n\nand relentless tendency to wane\n\nmight have only exacerbated your pain).\n\nIf I could have given you something\n\nyou could depend on, could always trust\n\n \n\nwithout a second thought, I would have.\n\nA splendid view, perhaps, or a strain\n\nof music. A favorite dish.

Could you tell—\n\nor were you so overcome your pain was all\n\nthat mattered? It seemed to me we were a kind\n\nof kin: willing the mind its bold suspensions,\n\n \n\nbut the heart, once shattered, never quite matching\n\nits old dimensions. And yet you persevered\n\nin spite of pain, you knew to hold hope\n\nas lightly as you held my hand (a phantom grasp,\n\na clasp that seemed to come from the other side).\n\nAnd your genial smile made it plain: you were pleased\n\nby my wish to please.

The Orders,"One spring night, at the end of my street\n\nGod was lying in wait.\n\n \n\nA friend and I were sitting in his new sedan\n\nlike a couple of cops on surveillance,\n\nshooting the breeze to pass the time,\n\nchatting up the daydreams, the raw deals,\n\nall the wouda-coulda-shoulda’s,\n\nthe latest “Can you believe that?”\n\nAs well as the little strokes of luck,\n\nthe so-called triumphs, small and unforeseen,\n\nthat kept us from cashing it all in.\n\n \n\nAnd God, who’s famous for working\n\nin mysterious ways and capable of anything,\n\ntook the form of a woman and a man,\n\neach dressed in dark clothes and desperate enough\n\nto walk up to the car and open the doors.\n\n \n\nAnd God put a gun to the head of my friend—\n\nright against the brain stem, where the orders go out\n\nnot only to the heart and the lungs\n\nbut to consciousness itself—a cold muzzle aimed\n\nat where the oldest urges still have their day:\n\nthe one that says eat whatever’s at hand,\n\nthe one that wants only to fuck,\n\nthe one that will kill if it has to…\n\n \n\nAnd God said not to look at him\n\nor he’d blow us straight to kingdom come,\n\nand God told us to keep our hands\n\nto ourselves, as if she weren’t that kind of girl.\n\n \n\nSuddenly time was nothing,\n\nour lives were cheap, the light in the car\n\ncold, light from a hospital,\n\nlight from a morgue.

Little as it is, pitiful as it seems,\n\nthis is what they were given, and they don’t want to lose it.\n\n \n\nThe gawky and the slow, the motley and the misshapen…\n\nWhat bliss to be walking in their midst as if I were one of them,\n\njust ride this gentle wave of idiocy, forget those who profess\n\nan interest in my welfare, look passing strangers in the eye\n\nfor something we might have in common, and be unconcerned if nothing’s there.\n\nAnd now we peek into a dark café, and now we mug at the waitress\n\nwhose feet are sore, whose smile makes up for the tacky carnations\n\nand white uniform makes it easy to mistake her for a nurse,\n\neven makes it necessary, given the state of the world.\n\n \n\nAnd when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,\n\nwhat comfort to know he’s a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,\n\nsmall wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets.

Book Review: The Mountain Lion by Jean Stafford,"Spoiler alert: in this all-but-forgotten\n\nmasterwork, Jean Stafford—who was once\n\nwidely regarded as the leading novelist\n\n \n\nof her generation, and who wrote\n\nthis perverse, short,\n\nlyrical novel, her second, during\n\n \n\nthe flailing failings\n\nof her marriage to my hero\n\nRobert Lowell—kills\n\n \n\nMolly, her child-alter ego,\n\na girl too unloved and unloving\n\nto survive puberty, too\n\n \n\npure and awful—like Stafford, who died\n\npickled and childish three\n\ndecades later after winning\n\n \n\nthe Pulitzer with her devastating,\n\nhurtfully compassionate Collected Stories—for this or any other world,\n\n \n\nespecially the necessarily\n\nallegorical one of fiction.\n\nI am broken now, hopeless; hope\n\n \n\nis proved by this book to be\n\na contrivance. I have just\n\nread the last pages in which\n\n \n\nMolly’s brother, Ralph—who,\n\nto live, cannot love\n\neither, has no spare love—shoots\n\n \n\nher, aiming for the wild mountain\n\nlion whose stuffed corpse\n\nwas to be the triumph\n\n \n\nof his new manhood. I don’t\n\nhate Ralph—how can I, a boy,\n\nmistaken, like me? And can I hate\n\n \n\nMolly, who so needed Ralph\n\nand everyone, still young enough to savor\n\nthe bittersweet of her anger?\n\n \n\nWhat about Stafford, who hurt\n\nherself, all our selves, with\n\nthis ending, her classic tragedy, writing,\n\n \n\ndecades later, Poor old Molly! I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace.\n\n \n\nFuck insight and analysis:\n\nmy heart is shot. Why\n\ndid she have to die? Why does\n\n \n\nanyone? Why do you, do I?\n\nBecause of what Ralph was\n\nfeeling just before he accidentally\n\n \n\nslaughtered the future? This book\n\nmust have ravaged the already\n\nsleepless poet Gregory Orr,\n\n \n\nwho shot his brother, too, and\n\nsuffers that endless error\n\nin poetry and prose. And because Molly\n\n \n\nrefused everything, she stood between\n\nRalph and tomorrow. But he grew, he\n\nchanged. Confused? Read\n\n \n\nthe book. In novels\n\npeople die because of what they feel.\n\nIn life, people die when\n\n \n\ntheir bodies conk out,\n\nexhausted machines that living\n\nexpends. And what\n\n \n\nhappens when people feel\n\ntheir feelings in life?\n\nNothing? Anything? Brenda,\n\n \n\ndear Brenda, my love, nothing\n\nhappens, I’m afraid. I’m sorry. And afraid.\n\nA small breeze born in the heart\n\n \n\ngently bends a blade of grass\n\nand no one hears a word.\n\nNo one reads Stafford anymore—I asked\n\n \n\non Facebook. Stafford died, her\n\nlegacy gently dispatched\n\ninto the low air. O, life\n\n \n\nis terrible, literature\n\nridiculous. Stafford’s prose,\n\nteeming and rich as loam,\n\n \n\ncould take Famous Franzen’s\n\nfor a walk, feed it biscuits.\n\nBut who cares? Who remembers?\n\n \n\nO, to have been Jean Stafford,\n\nin the past I idealize, when the world\n\nwas less self-conscious, less\n\n \n\nprecise. I could be\n\ndead already, warmish\n\nbeneath a blanket of dust. Joyful\n\n \n\nare the faded, the once-greats\n\nwhose afterlives slipped out\n\na hole in posterity's pocket:\n\n \n\nthey are loved poignantly by\n\na needy few. O, to be kept\n\ncozy in the bosoms of those\n\n \n\ndesperate and proud, forgotten\n\nfor all the good I do. Love\n\nis sunlight streaming unevenly\n\n \n\nthrough the canopy of leaves\n\noverhead. We can only grow\n\nin the brighter patches below, fading\n\n \n\nwhere light is thin.

Only animals, insects, beings without comprehension.\n\n\n \n\n\nA house on a corner lot, good to look up at from the corner, compels. Branches of live oak reach across the way. There must be acorns, black, green, green with earth yellow.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe wind cools the walker. There is nothing to stop the wind up. It finds every walker in its path, cools him, cools her.\n\n\n \n\n\nDirector must direct and make decisions. Buildings on the edges of developments look out over edges.

To be accused, rightly or wrongly, feels the same.\n\n\n \n\n\nOld man must speak against his own best interests, for he cannot swallow his complaints, not all of them. Glassware touching glassware gets chipped, broken into triangles, in the move.\n\n\n \n\n\nVital sheet of paper must sometimes be lost. Papers are many.

The thought that nothing can ever go right again must depart for a time.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe light must change. The waiting person wait longer.

The hated one, the cheated many, are the poor.\n\n\n \n\n\nLean grackle must stalk a branch, mouth open like scissors. Striped raptors, wings in fixed positions, must kite, must circle.\n\n\n \n\n\nBeautiful Soul wants a world in which he or she has no place. Godspeed, sweet intent. Love will creep where it cannot go.\n\n\n \n\n\nStick-figure reptiles, black, must cross the sidewalk by the pool, dartingly. They weigh one paperclip.\n\n\n \n\n\nBeauty enslaves on contact.

There must be holes in the decomposing concrete, paint invisible at sunrise and sunset, guardrails, median strips, shrines.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe student must wait to do the assignment, wait beyond the advisable point, stay up against a deadline.

Must pour, from the sky, rarely, chips and balls and coins and smooth clusters of partly white, partly clear ice.\n\n\n \n\n\nSome believe, helplessly. Others, less. Some count, tabulate, helplessly. They check calendars. They can’t shake it.\n\n\n \n\n\nWinter travels, hides, shelters. It pursues the lightly dressed into buildings during summer. It lies in wait in restaurants, miscalculates.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe pill and its coating, obnoxious to the child, are welcome enough to the grown swallower. First deserve and then desire. Blow first and sip afterwards.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe wise let it go a great deal. Sorrow is wondrously clinging; clouds glide. The friend who comes apologizing and promising must be received.

Drugs are traded, caresses.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe dog in its heavy coat must lie, half dead, on the porch. Eyes like a bear, tongue like a lion, lethargy.\n\n\n \n\n\nOne must consciously retire. Comes off a train none but was on it. The heirloom ring, wrong-gendered, trash, gets rescued.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the spirit of praising is upon him, a man will judge linen by candlelight.

Only the girls got to go\n\nas the boys were too wild.\n\nWe stood in line, wiggling with excitement as the man\n\ntalked about how they made hot dogs, then he handed us\n\none, and Jan dropped hers, so I broke mine in half.\n\nThis was the happiest day of our lives,\n\nchildren whose mothers didn't drive, and had nowhere\n\nto go but school and home, to be taken to that street\n\nto watch the glittering steel and shining rubber belts moving,\n\nmoving meats, readymade.  I wish I could talk with Jan,\n\nrecalling the miracle and thrill of the hot dog factory,\n\nwhen she was alive, before it all stopped—\n\nbright lights, glistening motors, spinning wheels.\n\n ",Grace Cavalieri,,3

The Day,"We walked at the edge of the sea, the dog,\n\nstill young then, running ahead of us.\n\n \n\nFew people.  Gulls.

An After Hour,"When one thing is becoming another, when writing is morphing, when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night, fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing; typewriters, even a nib and ink well, and considering all the ways of stretching a space, digital or hard copy; hard copy, an ugly expression for printed matter, and for that matter, printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty. Page, a soft and elongated word; page, an extension at the end of my fingers; page, a screen that holds dreams and desires; the page of legal document that bind. The page is a promise. I read all sides, turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what I may have missed.\n\nDesire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid. The pen is a body, an anatomy, not an earthworm with indecipherable ends; the pen has a head and tail, and inky guts. And the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks.\n\nlater hours/another hour/late hours/early hours/happy hour/visiting hours.\n\n\nAll the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop, in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery. Finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses, but I know the nest is early paper, the raw ingredients and pulp. I know the world is a page turner, a paper globe, and I know that the birds are the great writers of the sky.",Brenda Coultas,"Living,Time & Brevity,Arts & Sciences,Poetry & Poets,Social Commentaries,History & Politics",0

Hell Pig,"To keep me from staying out late at night, \n\nmy mother warned of the Hell Pig. Black and full\n\nof hot drool, eyes the color of a lung—it'd follow me\n\nhome if I stayed past my curfew.

"from Aurora Leigh, First Book","In those days, though, I never analysed\n\nMyself even. All analysis comes late.\n\nYou catch a sight of Nature, earliest,\n\nIn full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink\n\nAnd drop before the wonder of ‘t; you miss\n\nThe form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,\n\nAnd wrote because I lived–unlicensed else:\n\nMy heart beat in my brain. Life’s violent flood\n\nAbolished bounds,–and, which my neighbour’s field,\n\nWhich mine, what mattered? It is so in youth.\n\nWe play at leap-frog over the god Term;\n\nThe love within us and the love without\n\nAre mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,\n\nWe scarce distinguish. So, with other power.\n\nBeing acted on and acting seem the same:\n\nIn that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels,\n\nWe know not if the forests move or we.\n\nAnd so, like most young poets, in a flush\n\nOf individual life, I poured myself\n\nAlong the veins of others, and achieved\n\nMere lifeless imitations of life verse,\n\nAnd made the living answer for the dead,\n\nProfaning nature. ‘Touch not, do not taste,\n\nNor handle,’–we’re too legal, who write young:\n\nWe beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,\n\nAs if still ignorant of counterpoint;\n\nWe call the Muse ... ‘O Muse, benignant Muse!’–\n\nAs if we had seen her purple-braided head.\n\nWith the eyes in it start between the boughs\n\nAs often as a stag’s. What make-believe,\n\nWith so much earnest! what effete results,\n\nFrom virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes\n\nFrom such white heats!–bucolics, where the cows\n\nWould scare the writer if they splashed the mud\n\nIn lashing off the flies,–didactics, driven\n\nAgainst the heels of what the master said;\n\nAnd counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps\n\nA babe might blow between two straining cheeks\n\nOf bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;\n\nAnd elegiac griefs, and songs of love,\n\nLike cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,\n\nThe worse for being warm: all these things, writ\n\nOn happy mornings, with a morning heart,\n\nThat leaps for love, is active for resolve,\n\nWeak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms\n\nWill thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood.\n\nThe wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,\n\nWill crack even, as the new wine gurgles in.\n\nSpare the old bottles!–spill not the new wine.\n\nBy Keats’s soul, the man who never stepped\n\nIn gradual progress like another man,\n\nBut, turning grandly on his central self,\n\nEnsphered himself in twenty perfect years\n\nAnd died, not young,–(the life of a long life,\n\nDistilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear\n\nUpon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn\n\nFor ever;) by that strong excepted soul,\n\nI count it strange, and hard to understand,\n\nThat nearly all young poets should write old;\n\nThat Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen,\n\nAnd beardless Byron academical,\n\nAnd so with others. It may be, perhaps,\n\nSuch have not settled long and deep enough\n\nIn trance, to attain to clairvoyance,–and still\n\nThe memory mixes with the vision, spoils,\n\nAnd works it turbid.\n\n                  Or perhaps, again,\n\nIn order to discover the Muse-Sphinx,\n\nThe melancholy desert must sweep round,\n\nBehind you, as before.–\n\nFor me, I wrote\n\nFalse poems, like the rest, and thought them true.\n\nBecause myself was true in writing them.\n\nI, peradventure, have writ true ones since\n\nWith less complacence.\n\n                    But I could not hide\n\nMy quickening inner life from those at watch.\n\nThey saw a light at a window now and then,\n\nThey had not set there. Who had set it there?\n\nMy father’s sister started when she caught\n\nMy soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say\n\nI had no business with a sort of soul,\n\nBut plainly she objected,–and demurred,\n\nThat souls were dangerous things to carry straight\n\nThrough all the spilt saltpetre of the world.\n\nShe said sometimes, ‘Aurora, have you done\n\nYour task this morning?–have you read that book?\n\nAnd are you ready for the crochet here?’–\n\nAs if she said, ‘I know there’s something wrong,\n\nI know I have not ground you down enough\n\nTo flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust\n\nFor household uses and proprieties,\n\nBefore the rain has got into my barn\n\nAnd set the grains a-sprouting. What, you’re green\n\nWith out-door impudence? you almost grow?’\n\nTo which I answered, ‘Would she hear my task,\n\nAnd verify my abstract of the book?\n\nAnd should I sit down to the crochet work?\n\nWas such her pleasure?’ ... Then I sate and teased\n\nThe patient needle til it split the thread,\n\nWhich oozed off from it in meandering lace\n\nFrom hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad;\n\nMy soul was singing at a work apart\n\nBehind the wall of sense, as safe from harm\n\nAs sings the lark when sucked up out of sight,\n\nIn vortices of glory and blue air.\n\nAnd so, through forced work and spontaneous work,\n\nThe inner life informed the outer life,\n\nReduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms,\n\nMade cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,\n\nAnd, rounding to the spheric soul the thin\n\nPined body, struck a colour up the cheeks,\n\nThough somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across\n\nMy blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,\n\nAnd said, ‘We’ll live, Aurora! we’ll be strong.\n\nThe dogs are on us–but we will not die.’\n\n \n\n ",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Relationships,Men & Women,Social Commentaries,Gender & Sexuality",0
"from Aurora Leigh, Second Book","'There it is!–\n\nYou play beside a death-bed like a child,\n\nYet measure to yourself a prophet's place\n\nTo teach the living.

Your quick-breathed hearts,\n\nSo sympathetic to the personal pang,\n\nClose on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up\n\nA whole life at each wound; incapable\n\nOf deepening, widening a large lap of life\n\nTo hold the world-full woe.

Therefore, this same world\n\nUncomprehended by you must remain\n\nUninfluenced by you. Women as you are,\n\nMere women, personal and passionate,\n\nYou give us doating mothers, and chaste wives.\n\nSublime Madonnas, and enduring saints!\n\nWe get no Christ from you,–and verily\n\nWe shall not get a poet, in my mind.'\n\n'With which conclusion you conclude' . .\n\n                                    'But this–\n\nThat you, Aurora, with the large live brow\n\nAnd steady eyelids, cannot condescend\n\nTo play at art, as children play at swords,\n\nTo show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired\n\nBecause true action is impossible.\n\nYou never can be satisfied with praise\n\nWhich men give women when they judge a book\n\nNot as mere work, but as mere woman's work,\n\nExpressing the comparative respect\n\nWhich means the absolute scorn.

I am young,\n\nAnd peradventure weak–you tell me so–\n\nThrough being a woman. And, for all the rest,\n\nTake thanks for justice. I would rather dance\n\nAt fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped\n\nTheir gingerbread for joy,–than shift the types\n\nFor tolerable verse, intolerable\n\nTo men who act and suffer. Better far,\n\nPursue a frivolous trade by serious means,\n\nThan a sublime art frivolously.'\n\n*\n\nThen I spoke.\n\n'I have not stood long on the strand of life,\n\nAnd these salt waters have had scarcely time\n\nTo creep so high up as to wet my feet.\n\nI cannot judge these tides–I shall, perhaps.\n\nA woman's always younger than a man\n\nAt equal years, because she is disallowed\n\nMaturing by the outdoor sun and air,\n\nAnd kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.\n\nAh well, I know you men judge otherwise!\n\nYou think a woman ripens as a peach,–\n\nIn the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now;\n\nI'm young in age, and younger still, I think,\n\nAs a woman. But a child may say amen\n\nTo a bishop's prayer and see the way it goes;\n\nAnd I, incapable to loose the knot\n\nOf social questions, can approve, applaud\n\nAugust compassion, christian thoughts that shoot\n\nBeyond the vulgar white of personal aims.\n\nAccept my reverence.'\n\n                  There he glowed on me\n\nWith all his face and eyes. 'No other help?'\n\nSaid he–'no more than so?'\n\n                    'What help?' I asked.\n\n'You'd scorn my help,–as Nature's self, you say,\n\nHas scorned to put her music in my mouth,\n\nBecause a woman's. Do you now turn round\n\nAnd ask for what a woman cannot give?'\n\n'For what she only can, I turn and ask,'\n\nHe answered, catching up my hands in his,\n\nAnd dropping on me from his high-eaved brow\n\nThe full weight of his soul,–'I ask for love,\n\nAnd that, she can; for life in fellowship\n\nThrough bitter duties–that, I know she can;\n\nFor wifehood ... will she?'\n\n                      'Now,' I said, 'may God\n\nBe witness 'twixt us two!' and with the word,\n\nMeseemed I floated into a sudden light\n\nAbove his stature,–'am I proved too weak\n\nTo stand alone, yet strong enough to bear\n\nSuch leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,\n\nYet rich enough to sympathise with thought?\n\nIncompetent to sing, as blackbirds can,\n\nYet competent to love, like HIM?'\n\n                            I paused:\n\nPerhaps I darkened, as the lighthouse will\n\nThat turns upon the sea. 'It's always so!\n\nAnything does for a wife.'\n\n                      'Aurora, dear,\n\nAnd dearly honoured' ... he pressed in at once\n\nWith eager utterance,–'you translate me ill.\n\nI do not contradict my thought of you\n\nWhich is most reverent, with another thought\n\nFound less so. If your sex is weak for art,\n\n(And I who said so, did but honour you\n\nBy using truth in courtship) it is strong\n\nFor life and duty. Place your fecund heart\n\nIn mine, and let us blossom for the world\n\nThat wants love's colour in the grey of time.\n\nWith all my talk I can but set you where\n\nYou look down coldly on the arena-heaps\n\nOf headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!\n\nThe Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way\n\nThrough such a heap of generalised distress,\n\nTo the individual man with lips and eyes–\n\nMuch less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down,\n\nAnd, hand in hand, we'll go where yours shall touch\n\nThese victims, one by one! till one by one,\n\nThe formless, nameless trunk of every man\n\nShall seem to wear a head, with hair you know,\n\nAnd every woman catch your mother's face\n\nTo melt you into passion.'\n\n                      'I am a girl,'\n\nI answered slowly; 'you do well to name\n\nMy mother's face. Though far too early, alas,\n\nGod's hand did interpose 'twixt it and me,\n\nI know so much of love, as used to shine\n\nIn that face and another. Just so much;\n\nNo more indeed at all. I have not seen\n\nSo much love since, I pray you pardon me,\n\nAs answers even to make a marriage with,\n\nIn this cold land of England. What you love,\n\nIs not a woman, Romney, but a cause:\n\nYou want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,–\n\nA wife to help your ends ... in her no end!\n\nYour cause is noble, your ends excellent,\n\nBut I, being most unworthy of these and that,\n\nDo otherwise conceive of love. Farewell.'\n\n'Farewell, Aurora, you reject me thus?'\n\nHe said.\n\n        'Why, sir, you are married long ago.\n\nYou have a wife already whom you love,\n\nYour social theory. Bless you both, I say.\n\nFor my part, I am scarcely meek enough\n\nTo be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.\n\nDo I look a Hagar, think you?'\n\n                          'So, you jest!'\n\n'Nay so, I speak in earnest,' I replied.\n\n'You treat of marriage too much like, at least,\n\nA chief apostle; you would bear with you\n\nA wife ... a sister ... shall we speak it out?\n\nA sister of charity.'\n\n                 'Then, must it be\n\nIndeed farewell? And was I so far wrong\n\nIn hope and in illusion, when I took\n\nThe woman to be nobler than the man,\n\nYourself the noblest woman,–in the use\n\nAnd comprehension of what love is,–love,\n\nThat generates the likeness of itself\n\nThrough all heroic duties? so far wrong\n\nIn saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,\n\n'Come, human creature, love and work with me,'–\n\nInstead of, 'Lady, thou art wondrous fair,\n\n'And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse\n\n'Will follow at the lighting of the eyes,\n\n'And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep\n\n'Turn round and love me, or I die of love.''\n\nWith quiet indignation I broke in.\n\n'You misconceive the question like a man,\n\nWho sees a woman as the complement\n\nOf his sex merely. You forget too much\n\nThat every creature, female as the male,\n\nStands single in responsible act and thought\n\nAs also in birth and death. Whoever says\n\nTo a loyal woman, 'Love and work with me,'\n\nWill get fair answers, if the work and love\n\nBeing good themselves, are good for her–the best\n\nShe was born for. Women of a softer mood,\n\nSurprised by men when scarcely awake to life,\n\nWill sometimes only hear the first word, love,\n\nAnd catch up with it any kind of work,\n\nIndifferent, so that dear love go with it:\n\nI do not blame such women, though, for love,\n\nThey pick much oakum; earth's fanatics make\n\nToo frequently heaven's saints. But me, your work\n\nIs not the best for,–nor your love the best,\n\nNor able to commend the kind of work\n\nFor love's sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir,\n\nTo be over-bold in speaking of myself,–\n\nI, too, have my vocation,–work to do,\n\nThe heavens and earth have set me, since I changed\n\nMy father's face for theirs,–and though your world\n\nWere twice as wretched as you represent\n\nMost serious work, most necessary work,\n\nAs any of the economists'. Reform,\n\nMake trade a Christian possibility,\n\nAnd individual right no general wrong;\n\nWipe out earth's furrows of the Thine and Mine,\n\nAnd leave one green, for men to play at bowls;\n\nWith innings for them all! ... what then, indeed,\n\nIf mortals were not greater by the head\n\nThan any of their prosperities? what then,\n\nUnless the artist keep up open roads\n\nBetwixt the seen and unseen,–bursting through\n\nThe best of your conventions with his best\n\nThe unspeakable, imaginable best\n\nGod bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond\n\nBoth speech and imagination? A starved man\n\nExceeds a fat beast: we'll not barter, sir,\n\nThe beautiful for barley.–And, even so,\n\nI hold you will not compass your poor ends\n\nOf barley-feeding and material ease,\n\nWithout a poet's individualism\n\nTo work your universal. It takes a soul,\n\nTo move a body: it takes a high-souled man,\n\nTo move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:\n\nIt takes the ideal, to blow a hair's breadth off\n\nThe dust of the actual.–ah, your Fouriers failed,\n\nBecause not poets enough to understand\n\nThat life develops from within.–For me,\n\nPerhaps I am not worthy, as you say,\n\nOf work like this! ... perhaps a woman's soul\n\nAspires, and not creates! yet we aspire,\n\nAnd yet I'll try out your perhapses, sir;\n\nAnd if I fail ... why, burn me up my straw\n\nLike other false works–I'll not ask for grace,\n\nYour scorn is better, cousin Romney. I\n\nWho love my art, would never wish it lower\n\nTo suit my stature. I may love my art,\n\nYou'll grant that even a woman may love art,\n\nSeeing that to waste true love on anything,\n\nIs womanly, past question.'\n\n \n\n ",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Relationships,Men & Women,Social Commentaries,Gender & Sexuality",2

He was an orphan.\n\nAs we pulled into the weed lot of the camp\n\nin the uncertain March air and patented silence,\n\nI could see him peeking down at us\n\nfrom a second story dormer window,\n\nlike someone who had been dreaming of escape\n\nfrom the run-down resort: torn up turf; dirt\n\nbasketball court, net hanging for its life by one\n\nthin strand of rope; horseshoes, shuffle board;\n\nmusty, mildewed cabins with wet bedding;\n\nthe stars pressing too hard against our faces\n\nin the catastrophic silence of the nights…\n\nI’d never been left so happily alone,\n\nalone, that is, in Warren’s wonderful company.\n\nHis talk mimicked the cadence of the stones he kicked.\n\nWarren showed me the mica glow in the arrowheads\n\nand quartz-tipped spears he'd unearthed.\n\nWarren's cigar box overflowed with other people's\n\nsouvenirs, miniature monuments, key chains, lighters,\n\nand initialed items like cuff links and bracelets.\n\nHe scoured the corners of the rooms of the departed\n\nwhile his “mother,” slip of the tongue there, vacuumed.\n\n“People always leave something behind,” he said.\n\nI knew what he meant: taking their clothes\n\non and off so many times something\n\nhad to go. I wanted an initial bracelet\n\neven with someone else’s initials.\n\nThe kids at summer camp in the Poconos all had\n\ninitialed bracelets, except for me,\n\nbut who among them had been west\n\nof the Mississippi?\n\nWarren wanted a home. I didn’t know what I wanted.\n\nI asked to bring Warren home and give him a home.\n\n“That’s ridiculous, he has a home here.\n\nBesides, you only just met.”\n\nMy mother lamented his stick-thin, soot-blackened frame,\n\nthe smell he gave off and his yellow teeth,\n\nhis urchin eating with his hands,\n\nhis short and choppy hair,\n\nhis blousy shirt and baggy fatigues\n\nthat gave him a bulk, a volume,\n\nhe didn’t otherwise possess.\n\nWhat about his fits of giddy delight?\n\nAs the days passed I forgot myself.\n\nI became more and more like Warren.\n\nI would brook no insults about my brother.\n\nIt would no longer be me, but me and Warren.\n\nI’d share my meals with Warren, and my desk at school.\n\nWarren could stay and I would just—slip away.\n\nNext to Warren, I felt like I was on a clipper ship\n\nlifted out of the water by the powerful wind-breath\n\nof my two distant coastal families; my warring\n\nmother and “blood” father, her lovely\n\ncompanionable family in Los Angeles and Manhattan;\n\nhis friendly, compliant relations in Manhattan and Bensonhurst…\n\nI dreamt both families were jammed on the deck\n\nof the ship, waving, gesticulating, shouting,\n\nand that I clung to a raft’s rope as a great\n\nwave flung me back and back, but the truth\n\nwas I wasn’t sure I wanted to be near.\n\nI wanted to fly apart—in the nowhere—.\n\nWhen our two-door Chrysler Windsor\n\nedged off the gravel onto the highway\n\nI thrust my head right where the plush fabric\n\nof the front seat parted like the Red Sea,\n\nand said to my new dad. “You know what.\n\nI love Warren more than I love you.”\n\n“You don’t know what you’re saying,” he snapped.\n\n“He’s just a little putz, and I can get\n\nrid of him with a snap\n\nof my fingers. Presto. See. Now—where is he?”\n\nThe seat beside me was empty. I was empty.\n\nAnd my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost.\n\nI should have kept my mouth shut\n\nbut I thought my heart would burst\n\nwith that secret locked in it: why doesn’t he\n\nunderstand? It wasn’t that I loved him less than I had\n\nbut that I loved Warren more. He had the same reaction\n\nseveral years later, in Chicago, when I announced\n\nmy love for Carol, a round-faced, soft spoken blond girl\n\nI’d brought home to play with my electric trains and drink\n\nhot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon. I loved her and\n\nI kissed her in the elevator on the way up.\n\nI wanted him to say: I’m so happy for you,let’s put on some 45’s and dance.\n\nHe said, “You don't know what love is.”\n\nAnd for the first time slapped me in the face.\n\nI wrote my “blood” father of my love and he wrote back\n\nhe was glad I was “making friends out there.”\n\nWhy didn’t these men understand, I know what words mean,\n\nby love I meant love, however transitory.\n\nOne word, two fathers, two red stone faces,\n\nunblinking, dismayed.",Mark Rudman,"Love,Realistic & Complicated,Relationships,Family & Ancestors",3
from Rider: [8. Dropouts],"Dropouts\n\n \n\nMace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake\n\nfor brawn. I don’t know why I call it courage.\n\n \n\nSure, he stood up to greasers.

Mace scorned them.\n\nHe only smoked Marlboros.\n\n \n\nYet later, desperate and broke in the maze\n\nof roads through the hills overlooking the city,\n\n \n\nhe broke off the filters and smoked in silence.\n\nI was used to doing the talking\n\n \n\nfor the two of us but this was different.\n\nHe pulled up besides a long driveway.\n\n \n\nA vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs.\n\nThis was where he lived. He’d be\n\n \n\n“a sec”—he had “some smokes” stashed in a drawer.\n\nI followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees\n\n \n\ntoward an opulent, utterly contemporary house,\n\nfronted by oak door and gold bell-knocker,\n\n \n\nangular, white, high-ceilinged, skylit…\n\nOur apartment could have fit into the living room…\n\n \n\nNow I understood: Mace lived in the clouds.\n\nThough I couldn’t see beyond the back yard\n\n \n\nthrough the landscaping I knew what the view\n\nmust be like: that was the reason to live there;\n\n \n\nfor the nights, when the city, innocent as it was,\n\nstill blazed through its grid of interlocking lights.\n\n                                                               *\n\n \n\nOn May Day, Mace and I, long ago tossed\n\nout of R.O.T.C. for “insubordination,”\n\n \n\nbut required to attend the final show-of-arms\n\nsat together in the bleachers,\n\n \n\nin splendid isolation, and watched\n\nas the rule-followers—led\n\n \n\nby the many-striped, other Mark R.—\n\nin their woolen khaki uniforms,\n\n \n\nshouldering their M 1 rifles,\n\ndropped like flies in the insuperable heat.\n\n ",Mark Rudman,"Living,Coming of Age,Activities,School & Learning,Relationships,Friends & Enemies",3

I was wrong\n\n \n\nabout the Polish Rider all along:\n\nhe doesn’t depart at nightfall, he stops for a moment\n\ncrossing difficult terrain (anticipating rockslide?)\n\nin the night, because, as the faint light\n\nrimming the edges of the sky makes clear,\n\nnight is not absolute black, but rough-hewn and curious.\n\nThe rider lives in order to depart.\n\n \n\n \n\n                                 The Woman Who Rode\n\n \n\nShe hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house.\n\nBare trees, frost, the whole bit.\n\n \n\nI wanted our lives to be like that:\n\nas rife with silences as a Quaker meeting.\n\n \n\nShe came to me in her stride.\n\nDropped her crop on the chair.\n\n \n\nPeeled off her britches and boots; crawled\n\nunder the covers.\n\n \n\nHer hour in the saddle had “made her ready.”\n\nI felt like an accessory.\n\n \n\nThe wound was open. Drowsily I rolled\n\nonto her, no longer caring if she\n\n \n\nwas using me. As the new\n\nyear wore on and black ice made riding\n\n \n\na fast track to certain death\n\nor paralysis, she grew tense.\n\n \n\nCame to me now with clinical terms,\n\n“schi” words I worked hard to break down.\n\n \n\nThe good news was she was not a true\n\n“split personality”—the glitch\n\n \n\nthat “she was divorced\n\nfrom herself, and could not love or care.”\n\n \n\n                                                                  *\n\n \n\nThe light in her house\n\nwas like the light before dawn.\n\n \n\nOn the last of my rare visits\n\nher mother jarred preserves while we watched\n\n \n\ninstant replays of Robert Kennedy die and die.\n\nHer father skulked upstairs, perhaps\n\n \n\ntesting gadgets; or wishing me off his daughter;\n\nor taking precautions I would not overhear\n\n \n\nwhat words were ricocheting\n\non his “hot line” to the patent office.\n\n \n\n                                                                 *\n\n \n\nAny objective observer standing back\n\nfrom the distraction of the impinging present\n\n \n\ncould see that her torment overleapt\n\nany visible signs and that she was—\n\n \n\nas a WASP “rider”—the wrong\n\nperson for the place she was in.\n\n \n\nHer resilience could not be in question.\n\nShe lived to stray from known paths\n\n \n\nto leap stone fences and break into open fields.\n\nWhen her horse went down in an Irish bog\n\n \n\nand she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek—\n\nthe next day she up and mounted him again.\n\n \n\n                                                                *\n\n \n\nWhen she came to me in the dream last night\n\nher smile had loosened.\n\n \n\nHow lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse.\n\nHow well it lit up the colors of her hair.",Mark Rudman,"Living,Life Choices,Love,Desire,Realistic & Complicated,Activities,Sports & Outdoor Activities,Religion,Judaism",7
poem for bruce,"Under the roof is the empty room\n\npapered in requiem blue.\n\n \n\nPartiers crowd the burned kitchen,\n\ngold fixtures hook to cheap lath.\n\n \n\nWhat is it they can tell you about absence\n\nhow it abates, takes names\n\n \n\nBecomes a wall with windows\n\nfaced on a formal garden, content\n\n \n\nTo accept the thin rain. The syllable\n\nforgives the words that need it, a sentence\n\n \n\nBadly written, epigraphs scrawled\n\nthoughtlessly in books. Book where the hero\n\n \n\nconfronts a dark riddle, book where\n\nthe suitors stand at the gate and are stumped.\n\n \n\nWhat force brought them forward\n\nstooping at the lintel, up the chipped steps\n\n \n\nTo the blue door in the unbuilt tower,\n\nhalf-built, the new stone.",Rodney Koeneke,"Relationships,Friends & Enemies,Arts & Sciences,Language & Linguistics,Reading & Books",0
Carpet Bomb,"I can’t get rid of useful things\n\nand nobody wants to pick them up,\n\nI keep forgetting where I lay my umbrella.\n\n \n\nI don’t leave footprints in the snow anymore,\n\nwe haven’t had a war on domestic soil in so long\n\nI wonder if I still got it. Because once I had it.\n\n \n\nI heard about a boy who once tied a string to his brother,\n\nhe tied his brother to the ocean and the ocean to the blackbird—\n\n \n\nfrom the ground all the birds look like blackbirds\n\nfrom the ground a Stealth Bomber looks like a spaceship.\n\n \n\nThe aliens are coming,\n\nthey walk through birthday parties\n\nand basically go unnoticed.\n\n \n\nAnd this is kind of how I go through life,\n\nonce I heated up a spoon in the microwave\n\nthe fish have so much mercury in them they spark.\n\n \n\nI was handed a bayonet from the Civil War\n\nand a copper penny corroded with rust.\n\nWhen they take the Statue of Liberty apart to clean her\n\nher neck explodes with a million little spiders.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile in a forest somewhere\n\nsomeone cut open my grandmother’s belly\n\nand filled it with bricks\n\n \n\nsomething is coming soon\n\nI keep a bucket of lambs blood\n\nby the front door.",Kenyatta Rogers,"Social Commentaries,History & Politics,War & Conflict",1
Antarctica,"Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor\n\nof a dugout, leaned our heads back,\n\neyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous\n\ncanisters into the communion shapes\n\nof our mouths, slipped inside where\n\neverything seemed to be falling snow,\n\nice, the time split between chasing flies\n\nthrough a darkened park and sprawling\n\nin sycamore bark—how clean that abyss\n\nwe drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,\n\non our skins; and, beneath, a want\n\nfor touch, a kiss, a return. Like nothing\n\nback then, to break an arm latching on\n\nto the bumper of an Impala, or settling back \n\nas the car took us as far as the salted bridge,\n\nbefore letting the ride go with a mitten\n\ncaught behind the chrome waving\n\nfrom the other side of the river. Like this, \n\nyou said, sliding a needle, watching\n\ndope plunge, the body's rush and tow\n\nuntil you felt something like an angel\n\nhovering above, but it was only pigeon\n\nfeathers deviling the air. Those friends\n\nare gone: some dead, dying, locked up\n\nor jailed in themselves; and when I see\n\nsome kids running in the heat of a taillight\n\nswirling behind them, I remember we\n\nwanted only to quiet our bodies, their \n\nunnatural hum, a vague pull inward,\n\nsome thin furrows gliding over the snow.

Teenage Riot,"All of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost\n\n      nothing else\n\nmattered but to learn some new trick,\n\nto pull off something we saw in a skate video, wind cutting \n\naround our bodies when we flew\n\noff the lip of a ramp, grabbed the board and twisted\n\ninto a 180, kicking \n\na leg out and landing it, the only way to run\n\nthrough the neighborhood\n\nwas to run through it\n\ntogether, flipping off cops and skinheads, I almost\n\ndon't even remember girls but a vague sense of the taste of bubble gum\n\nand how they smelled so different\n\nfrom us, sitting in some kid's basement drinking\n\nhis parents' vodka, we grew out our bangs, moved in a pack,\n\njumped in when some one of us \n\ngot jumped,\n\nso when a man we had never seen before\n\ncame up and started beating on Simon, one of us dropped his skateboard, walked\n\nover to the man\n\nlike someone walking into a bank\n\nand stabbed him.\n\nThe man, startled, sat down, right there on the asphalt,\n\nright in the middle of his new consciousness,\n\nkind of looking around.

Minimum Wage,"My mother and I are on the front porch lighting each other's cigarettes\n\nas if we were on a ten-minute break from our jobs\n\nat being a mother and son, just ten minutes\n\nto steal a moment of freedom before clocking back in, before\n\nputting the aprons back on, the paper hats,\n\nwashing our hands twice and then standing\n\nbehind the counter again,\n\nhoping for tips, hoping the customers\n\nwill be nice, will say some kind word, the cool\n\nfront yard before us and the dogs \n\nin the backyard shitting on everything.\n\nWe are hunched over, two extras on the set of The Night of the Hunter.\n\nI am pulling a second cigarette out of the pack, a swimmer\n\nrising from a pool of other swimmers. Soon we will go back\n\ninside and sit in the yellow kitchen and drink\n\nthe rest of the coffee \n\nand what is coming to kill us will pour milk\n\ninto mine and sugar into hers.",Matthew Dickman,"Love,Realistic & Complicated,Activities,Jobs & Working,Relationships,Family & Ancestors",1
